In order to ensure the reproducibility of the findings, we deposited all the data and code necessary to replicate the results shown in the paper on the project's GitHub repository (\url{https://github.com/YimenAraya-Ajoy/StochasticFluctuationsSparrows}). We deposited the data sets used for the analyses, SQL scripts to extract it from the main database and the R scripts to post-process the data. We also deposited the code for each stan model and its execution, as well as an R-object with the results. In the repository, reproducible code to generate all the tables in latex and figures can be found, and all results presented in the text can be obtained by executing the R script "In text Results". This procedure ensures a transparent data extraction contributing to reproducible science \citep{ODea2021}, where decisions regarding data selection are documented in R scripts and a log history.
